# Get Pump Gym Website

Welcome to the repository for the Get Pump Gym website. This project is a simple yet fully functional website designed to showcase the facilities, subscription plans, job opportunities, and branch locations of the Get Pump Gym. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it provides a solid foundation for future expansion and customization.

## Project Structure

The website consists of five main pages:

- `index.html`: The homepage that introduces visitors to Get Pump Gym, highlighting the gym's philosophy and inviting exploration of the facilities and services offered.
- `branchesPlaces.html`: Lists all the gym locations along with their specific features, helping potential members find their nearest and most suitable branch.
- `subscription.html`: Details the subscription options available, each with its own set of benefits, and directs users to the payment page for membership registration.
- `jobs.html`: A form page where interested candidates can apply for various job positions available at the gym.
- `payment.html`: A form that collects subscription payment details from users, finalizing their membership process.

### Styles and Scripts

- `style.css`: Contains the styling rules for the website, ensuring a consistent and attractive design across all pages.
- `script.js`: Provides basic JavaScript functionality to enhance user interaction and form processing.
